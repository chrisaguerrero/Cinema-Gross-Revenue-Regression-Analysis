Overview:
    The impact of global warming has been strongly linked with deforestation that occurs in the Amazon rain forest in South America. The Amazon runs for roughly 2,316,612.95 square miles across 9 nations such as Ecuador, Peru, Venezuela, Bolivia, Colombia, among others. However, the majority of the forest is located within Brazil, with 60% located within the country's borders. The Amazon's ecological importance ranges from impacting the Earth's gas emission balances, as well as containing over half the planet's animal, insect, and tree species within the forest.
    Sadly, due to private corporations, a lack of legislation protecting the forest, as well as an increase in crop production, the amount of damage to the Amazon has increased over time which has had a direct connection to having a direct negative impact on the environment, carbon emissions, and overall climate change effects. By using a linear regression model, we can predict the rate at which deforestation will continue to occur, and at what point there will be a critical "point of no return" that must be avoided, as well as look into the leading causes of deforestation over the years.
    
Question/ Need:
    Given the current rate of deforestation, the data pulled demonstrates the ecological impact over the following thirty years in an attempt to help our environmental conservation clients demonstrate to stake holders the importance on continuing awareness on the mission to help stop deforestation in the amazon rainforest and continuing to fund movements to help groups located in South America.  

Data:

The databases we are looking at for this project include:
    
- Deforestation metrics over the past number of years in Ecuador specifically

- Deforestation metrics over the Amazon as a whole, compared to in Ecuador

- Metrics of human-caused deforestation of the Amazon

- CO2 measurement levels that have to do with forest damage, and increases over the year relationship with forest damage levels. 

- Political Data on legislation that Ecuador has applied to decrease deforestation in the country

Tools:
- Web scraping tools- Beatiful Soup and Selenium
- Python for exploratory Data Analysis
- Python Visualization tools: MatplotLib/Plotly, and Seaborn
- Python tools such as Pandas, Numpy

By using these tools, I am hoping to web-scrape data in both tabular data as well as across several websites to pull in data on amount of rainforest lost over the past 50 years, as well as data containing the leading causes of deforestation over the years. 

MVP:
My initial goal for an MVP is to provide a simple regression model showing the relationship between deforestation in the amazon between over time and what the predicted deforestation percentage of the rainforst will look like over the next 30 years. The assumption made is that regardless of cause of deforestation, there is a linear correlation among time and amount of forest lost over the years. Environmental experts suggest that the irreversible tipping point occurs at roughly 50% of the rainforest being damaged. 

Past the MVP, I plan on looking into the correlations between causes of deforestation (natural, vs unnatural, slash/burn techniques, crops, etc) and seeing how each of these factors impact the rate at which the forest is damaged and their contribution to the overall quantity of rainforest lost.
